Keta Wakamiya Shrine, nestled in the charming town of Hida-Furukawa in Gifu Prefecture, has become an essential pilgrimage site for fans of Makoto Shinkai's critically acclaimed anime film, "Your Name" (Kimi no Na wa). While the Miyamizu Shrine depicted in the movie is a fictional composite, Keta Wakamiya Shrine, with its traditional architecture and serene atmosphere, is widely recognized by fans as a real-world counterpart and a significant location to visit when exploring the areas that inspired the film. The town of Hida-Furukawa itself features prominently in the movie, making this shrine a natural stop for those tracing the footsteps of Taki and Mitsuha.

**Getting There (Transit):**
The shrine is conveniently located within walking distance of Hida-Furukawa Station, which is accessible via the JR Takayama Line. From Nagoya, you can take a limited express train directly to Hida-Furukawa, a journey that typically takes around 2.5 to 3 hours. Once you arrive at Hida-Furukawa Station, the shrine is approximately a 15-20 minute leisurely walk through the picturesque town. Follow the signs, or simply enjoy the stroll past traditional houses and canals. For those driving, limited parking may be available nearby, but walking from the station is highly recommended to soak in the local ambiance.

**What to See and Photography Tips (Shooting Angles):**
Upon arrival, you'll be greeted by the impressive torii gate, marking the entrance to the sacred grounds. This is an excellent spot for your first wide-angle shot, capturing the gate against the backdrop of the shrine's approach. As you ascend the stone steps, look for opportunities to photograph the intricate details of the shrine buildings, particularly the main hall (Honden). The wooden architecture, often adorned with carvings, offers beautiful textures and patterns. Many fans leave ema (votive tablets) featuring "Your Name" artwork, which make for poignant close-up shots. Try to capture the shrine from various angles – a low shot looking up at the main hall can emphasize its grandeur, while a shot from the side might highlight the surrounding natural beauty. The interplay of light and shadow, especially in the early morning or late afternoon, can create dramatic effects. Don't forget to capture the serene forest setting that often surrounds Japanese shrines, adding to the spiritual atmosphere.

**Best Time to Visit (Timing):**
Visiting Keta Wakamiya Shrine in the early morning is ideal. Not only will you encounter fewer crowds, allowing for more peaceful contemplation and unobstructed photos, but the soft morning light often bathes the shrine in a gentle glow, perfect for photography. Spring (late March to April) offers the possibility of cherry blossoms, while autumn (October to November) transforms the surrounding hills with vibrant fall foliage, creating a stunning backdrop. Even in winter, a dusting of snow can lend a magical, ethereal quality to the shrine. Avoid visiting during major national holidays if you prefer a quieter experience, as these times can see an influx of tourists.

**Etiquette and Safety:**
As a sacred site, respectful behavior is paramount. Upon entering through the torii gate, it's customary to bow once. Proceed to the temizuya (water purification pavilion) to cleanse your hands and mouth before approaching the main hall. When praying at the main hall, the general procedure is to offer a coin, bow twice, clap twice, make your wish or prayer, and then bow once more. Photography is generally permitted in the outdoor areas, but always be mindful of other visitors and worshippers. Avoid using flash inside any enclosed structures, and refrain from making loud noises. Stay on designated paths and be aware of uneven surfaces, especially on stone steps. The shrine grounds are generally safe, but always be aware of your surroundings, particularly if visiting alone or after dusk. Embrace the tranquility and history of this special place, connecting with both Japanese culture and the magic of "Your Name."
