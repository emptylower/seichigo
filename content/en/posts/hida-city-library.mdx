The Hida City Library, nestled in the charming town of Hida-Furukawa in Gifu Prefecture, stands as an iconic pilgrimage site for fans of Makoto Shinkai's acclaimed anime film, 'Your Name' (Kimi no Na wa). This modern yet welcoming public library is instantly recognizable from the movie, serving as the very location where protagonist Taki Tachibana diligently researches the mysterious town of Itomori, searching for clues about Mitsuha Miyamizu. The anime meticulously recreates the library's interior, from the distinctive bookshelves to the specific study desks, making a visit here feel like stepping directly into the film.

To reach the Hida City Library, the most convenient method is by train. It's a short, pleasant walk from Hida-Furukawa Station (高山線), which is easily accessible from major cities. From Takayama, it's just a 15-minute train ride on the JR Takayama Line. If traveling from Nagoya or Gifu City, you can take the JR Hida Wide View limited express train directly to Hida-Furukawa, a scenic journey lasting approximately 2.5 to 3 hours. Once at the station, simply follow the signs or use a map; the library is centrally located within the town.

When planning your visit, consider the library's operating hours, which are typically from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM on weekdays and 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on weekends, though it's always wise to check their official website for the most current schedule and any holiday closures. Weekdays, particularly mornings, tend to be less crowded, offering a more serene experience for both anime pilgrims and regular patrons. The natural light during the morning hours also provides excellent conditions for photography.

For capturing those memorable 'Your Name' shots, several angles are recommended. The exterior of the library, with its distinctive modern architecture, is best photographed from across the street, allowing you to frame the entire building. Inside, the challenge is to replicate Taki's research scene. While the exact desk he used might not be explicitly marked, the general layout of the reading area and the specific design of the study carrels are highly accurate. Focus on capturing the atmosphere of quiet study, perhaps including the bookshelves in the background. Remember to use a camera with good low-light capabilities to avoid flash, which is strictly prohibited.

Etiquette and safety are paramount when visiting a working public library. Maintain absolute silence at all times; this is a place of study and contemplation for local residents. Photography is generally permitted for personal use, but always be discreet. Avoid using flash, do not use tripods, and most importantly, never disturb other patrons. If you wish to take a specific shot, it's courteous to ask a staff member first. Respect the library's rules and the privacy of its users. Keep your belongings secure and be mindful of your surroundings. The Hida City Library staff are generally very welcoming to 'Your Name' fans, often providing maps or information about other local pilgrimage spots, but this hospitality should be met with utmost respect for their primary function as a community resource. After your library visit, take time to explore the charming streets of Hida-Furukawa, which also feature other subtle nods to the anime, completing your 'Your Name' journey.
