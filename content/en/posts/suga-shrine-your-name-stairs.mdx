## Why this staircase deserves a dedicated page

The Suga Shrine stairs are one of the most recognizable real-world locations from *Your Name*. Fans usually remember this place not as a generic landmark, but as the emotional endpoint of the story. That makes it a high-intent search target: people are not just asking where it is, they want to know how to visit it well.

Unlike large sightseeing attractions, this is part of a daily neighborhood flow. Locals pass through the stairs for normal life. The best pilgrimage behavior is short, respectful, and intentional.

## Access and route

- Area: Suga Shrine / Yotsuya zone, Shinjuku, Tokyo
- Fast route: Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line to Yotsuya-sanchome Station, then walk
- Alternative: JR Yotsuya Station, then a slightly longer walk

Use the shrine area as your map anchor, then identify the red handrail staircase nearby. Many first-time visitors reach the shrine but miss the most recognizable camera line.

## Camera angles that actually work

### Angle A: top-down composition

This is the most iconic framing. From the upper section, aim downward so the red rails guide the eye through the frame.

### Angle B: mid-stair eye level

Great for two-person scene recreation. Put one person above and one below to capture the crossing-and-turning moment.

### Angle C: bottom-up perspective

Useful for side-by-side anime comparison shots. Slightly longer focal lengths keep the stairs from looking too stretched.

## Best timing

- Weekday morning: cleaner shots, fewer interruptions
- Late afternoon: warmer side light and stronger cinematic mood
- Late night: not recommended for long shoots in a quiet residential area

If you can only choose one window, morning is the safest. If you want mood and warm tones, go later in the day.

## Etiquette and safety

- Keep the path open
- Avoid blocking stairs with tripods
- Avoid loud playback or disruptive behavior
- Do not photograph private residences closely

The area remains pilgrimage-friendly because visitors generally keep a low impact. Respect directly improves your experience.

## Suggested half-day pairing

- Suga Shrine stairs (main point)
- Short Yotsuya neighborhood walk
- Optional Tokyo route continuation

As an SEO landing page, this spot can serve high-intent queries such as “Your Name stairs location” and “Suga Shrine pilgrimage guide.”
