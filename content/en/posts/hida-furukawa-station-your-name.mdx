## Why this station matters

Hida-Furukawa Station is not the loudest visual set piece in *Your Name*, but it is one of the strongest story-progression locations. It captures the searching phase of the narrative, which is why many fans want to visit it specifically, not just as part of a generic “Gifu tour.”

This page focuses on the practical questions users actually ask: what to shoot, where to walk, and how to keep the visit smooth.

## Access and timing

- Typical route: reach the Takayama area first, then continue to Hida-Furukawa
- Station size: compact and walkable
- Recommended stay: 1.5 to 2.5 hours

If you plan to pair this with the library and old-town streets, start here first while the flow is still calm.

## Core spot breakdown

### Spot 1: station exterior and signage

Capture one wide shot and one detail shot. This gives both context and recognizability for side-by-side comparisons.

### Spot 2: platform-adjacent movement lines

Instead of static-only photos, capture the path and pacing. The location works best when the frame suggests motion.

### Spot 3: transition to nearby streets

The walk from station to town streets helps bridge anime memory and real travel narrative. This is valuable for both readers and search intent.

## Photography tips

- Mid focal range keeps natural perspective
- Slightly tighter framing works better for station details
- Overcast conditions can feel closer to the movie’s softer look

For phone shooting, lock exposure before changing direction. Lighting differences between exterior and interior can cause inconsistent results.

## Etiquette

- Do not stop for long at active flow points
- Avoid intrusive face shots of passengers
- Keep shooting compact and courteous

## Suggested route combination

- Hida-Furukawa Station
- Hida City Library
- Nearby old-town walk
