## Why this deserves a dedicated landing page

The National Art Center, Tokyo is tied to the Tokyo relationship arc in *Your Name*. Fans who search this location usually want scene alignment and route clarity, not a generic museum overview.

A focused page helps users understand where to look, how to move through the space, and how to visit without disrupting other guests.

## Access and flow

- Reach the Roppongi/Nogizaka area first
- Start with exterior and lobby geometry
- Decide exhibit time separately from pilgrimage time

If your goal is scene recreation, you can still complete core references without a full exhibition day.

## Core reference points

### Point 1: exterior glass wave facade

Prioritize person-to-architecture scale shots, not only close-up facade textures.

### Point 2: interior curve lines and atrium rhythm

The architecture itself is the visual language. Use compositions that preserve lines and depth.

### Point 3: café context (Salon de thé ROND)

When writing this section, practical context matters: queue timing, seating expectations, and realistic waiting windows.

## Etiquette and constraints

- Follow posted photo rules by area
- Avoid blocking circulation points
- Keep setup compact and non-intrusive

This is an active cultural space, so respectful behavior is part of a successful pilgrimage.

## Timing guidance

- Weekday mornings are usually easier
- Peak daytime hours can be crowded
- Late-day windows are useful for quick pickups, not slow shoots

## Suggested Tokyo pairing

- Urban outdoor locations first
- National Art Center in the middle of the day
- Optional evening city-walk wrap-up

This page targets long-tail terms such as “Your Name National Art Center location” and “Your Name Tokyo date scene pilgrimage.”
