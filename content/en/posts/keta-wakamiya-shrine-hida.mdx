气多若宫神社 (Kita-Wakamiyajinja Shrine) in Hida City, Gifu Prefecture, holds a special allure for fans of Makoto Shinkai's critically acclaimed anime film, "Your Name" (君の名は。/ Kimi no Na wa.). While not explicitly named in the film, its striking resemblance to the Miyamizu Shrine, particularly its iconic stone staircase and traditional architecture, has cemented its status as a beloved pilgrimage site for anime enthusiasts. Visiting this serene shrine offers a tangible connection to the film's mystical world, allowing fans to walk in the footsteps of Taki and Mitsuha.

**Transit:** To reach Kita-Wakamiyajinja Shrine, your primary destination will be Hida-Furukawa Station. From major cities like Nagoya, take the JR Hida Wide View Limited Express train directly to Hida-Furukawa, a scenic journey lasting approximately 2.5 hours. If coming from Tokyo, take the Shinkansen to Nagoya first. Once at Hida-Furukawa Station, the shrine is conveniently located within a comfortable walking distance. Exit the station and head towards the old town area; the shrine is about a 10-15 minute walk, easily navigable with a map or smartphone GPS. The walk itself is pleasant, passing through charming streets that evoke the film's rural setting.

**Shooting Angles:** For photographers, the shrine offers numerous picturesque opportunities. The most iconic shot is undoubtedly the long, moss-covered stone staircase leading up to the main shrine building. A wide-angle lens is ideal here to capture the full grandeur of the ascent, especially from the base looking up, mirroring scenes from the anime. Experiment with different perspectives along the stairs, focusing on the interplay of light and shadow through the surrounding trees. Once at the top, capture the intricate details of the main hall (Honden) and the surrounding smaller shrines. Don't forget the torii gate at the entrance, often framed beautifully by seasonal foliage. Early morning light can create a magical, ethereal glow, perfect for replicating the film's aesthetic.

**Timing:** The best time to visit Kita-Wakamiyajinja Shrine largely depends on your preference for atmosphere and crowd levels. Early mornings, shortly after sunrise, are highly recommended. The soft, diffused light is excellent for photography, and you'll likely experience the shrine in tranquil solitude, enhancing the spiritual connection. Weekdays generally see fewer visitors than weekends. Seasonally, spring (late March to April) offers cherry blossoms, while autumn (late October to November) transforms the surrounding trees into a vibrant tapestry of reds and golds, both providing stunning backdrops. Winter visits, especially after a snowfall, can create a breathtaking, almost otherworldly scene, though be mindful of slippery steps.

**Etiquette and Safety:** As a sacred site, respectful conduct is paramount. Upon entering through the torii gate, it's customary to bow once. Proceed to the temizuya (water purification pavilion) to cleanse your hands and mouth before approaching the main hall. When offering prayers, typically you'll bow twice, clap twice, offer your prayer, and then bow once more. Photography is generally permitted in the outdoor areas, but always be mindful of other worshippers and avoid using flash inside any enclosed structures. Keep your voice low and avoid disruptive behavior. For safety, the stone steps can be slippery, especially when wet from rain or dew, so wear appropriate footwear and watch your footing. Be aware of your surroundings, particularly if visiting during less crowded times, and always keep personal belongings secure.
